# Modeling Molecular Cloud Temperatures and Star Formation

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for modeling molecular cloud temperatures, molecular line emissivities (i.e. HCN, CO and HCO+), and star formation rates. This work is built upon the foundational code from my published work: Bemis et al., (2024) A&A, 692, A146. The primary objective of this project is to understand the physical conditions that govern star formation in diverse galactic environments, with a particular emphasis on gas temperature profiles, variations in emissivity, and their influence on observational estimates of (dense) gas star formation efficiency.

A key uncertainty in molecular gas properties is kinetic temperature. This project builds off of the computational framework in Sharda & Krumholz, (2022) MNRAS, 509, 1959 to infer these temperatures. It combines this with radiative transfer modeling (via RADEX) to generate synthetic spectral line intensities of key molecular species (e.g., CO, HCN, HCO+). The derived temperatures are crucial for accurately characterizing the physical conditions (e.g., density, pressure) within molecular clouds, which in turn provides vital insights into the mechanisms and efficiency of star formation.

## Data Sources

This project utilizes and generates several types of data:

* **`model_subset300.csv`**: This file serves as the primary input data, containing a subset of 300 randomly sampled cloud properties derived from observational studies of nearby galaxies. These properties were constructed from:

    * Sun et al., (2020) ApJ, 892, 148 (PHANGS galaxies)

    * Brunetti et al., (2024) MNRAS, 530, 597 (the Antennae galaxies: NGC4038/9)

    * Brunetti et al., (2021) MNRAS, 500, 4730 (NGC3256)

* **`model_grid.tsv`**: This file is an *output* generated by the `input_measurements_grid.py` script, summarizing calculated model properties. It is not an input to the repository and will be ignored by Git.

* **`grid_COcooling_new.out`**: This is a necessary external input file containing CO cooling information that is included directly in this repository. The appropriate reference to cite for this data is Sharda & Krumholz, (2022) MNRAS, 509, 1959.

## Methodology

This project employs a multi-faceted computational approach to model molecular clouds and infer their properties:

* **Temperature Estimation**: The core of the model involves estimating gas temperatures by balancing various heating and cooling mechanisms (e.g., cosmic ray heating, dust-gas cooling, H2 formation heating). The temperature estimation code is based on the methodology described in Sharda & Krumholz, (2022) MNRAS, 509, 1959. This is primarily handled by `check_temp.py` and `temp_estimate.py`.

* **Density Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs)**: The project constructs PDFs based on turbulence and gravitational collapse theories to describe the density structure of the clouds. This allows for a statistical representation of the gas distribution. More information on the density profiles and PDFs used can be found in Bemis & Wilson, (2023) ApJ, 945, 42. Functions for this are implemented in `PDF_model_functions.py`.

* **Radiative Transfer Modeling**: This code employs RADEX (Radiative Transfer Code for Molecular Lines), integrated via `radex_functions.py`, to simulate molecular line emission from the modeled clouds. This provides crucial insights into their observable properties, such as line fluxes, excitation temperatures, and optical depths for species like CO, HCN, and HCO+.

* **Star Formation Rate (SFR) Calculation**: By integrating the derived PDFs with star formation efficiencies, the project estimates Star Formation Rates (SFRs) and depletion times based on analytical star formation theories (Burkhart, (2018) ApJ, 863, 118 and Burkhart & Mocz, (2019) ApJ, 879, 129) for the modeled clouds. Functions for these calculations are found in `emissivity_model_functions.py`.

* **Workflow Orchestration**:

    * `input_measurements_grid.py`: This script reads in cloud properties, estimates gas temperature profiles, and saves detailed model outputs and plots.

    * `run_model_grid.py`: This script processes the output from `input_measurements_grid.py` to perform radiative transfer calculations and derive molecular line properties and star formation characteristics. It runs sequentially in this repository version.

## Key Findings / Results

This modeling effort has yielded several key insights into molecular cloud properties and star formation:

* Our models successfully reproduce observed HCN and CO J=1-0 intensities across a wide range of galactic environments, consistent with previous numerical and observational studies.

* The modeled HCN/CO intensity ratio primarily tracks gas at moderate densities (approximately $n \sim 10^{3.5} \text{ cm}^{-3}$), rather than strictly dense gas (e.g., $n > 10^{4.5} \text{ cm}^{-3}$). This suggests that HCN/CO may not be a reliable tracer of the densest, gravitationally bound, star-forming gas fraction.

* Variations in CO emissivity are primarily driven by changes in optical depth due to gas dynamics, contributing significantly to the scatter observed in star formation scaling relations. In contrast, HCN emissivity is more strongly correlated with excitation, indicating different physical origins for their variations.

## How to Run the Project

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

0.  **Install RADEX (External Dependency):**

    This project relies on the RADEX radiative transfer code, which needs to be installed separately. Please follow the installation instructions available here: [https://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~moldata/radex.html](https://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~moldata/radex.html)

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    Open your terminal or command prompt and execute:

    ```
    git clone [https://github.com/ashleyrbemis/cloud-temperature-emissivity-model.git](https://github.com/ashleyrbemis/cloud-temperature-emissivity-model.git)
    cd cloud-temperature-emissivity-model
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate Conda Environment:**

    It is highly recommended to use a dedicated Conda environment to manage project dependencies.

    ```
    conda create -n model_hcn_co_env python=3.9
    conda activate model_hcn_co_env
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    All required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using pip:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Execute the Modeling Pipeline:**

    Run the scripts in the following order from the project's root directory:

    a.  **Run the initial cloud model calculations:**

        ```
        python input_measurements_grid.py
        ```

        This script will:

        * Read input cloud properties from `model_subset300.csv`.

        * Calculate various derived physical properties and averages (e.g., mass-weighted heating/cooling sums, effective densities).

        * Apply filtering conditions to ensure data quality.

        * Combine all processed data into a single `combined_model_output.csv` file for further analysis and plotting.
